Sagar Laud, Oliver Goldbart
We worked on this assignment alone using only this semester's course material
slaud3@gatech.edu

1: Sagar Laud and Oliver Goldbart
2: For the purpose of this project, I did a lot of the planning.  I came up with the idea of a DragonballZ theme as well as the idea of a Kamehameha wave.  I helped to write the programs.  Oliver and I divided the work evenly.  More specifically, he worked a lot with the special effect programs while I worked to convert all the images and audio to a final movie file.
3: We both did an equal amount of work and therefore each did 50% of the work.
